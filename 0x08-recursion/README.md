task

task 0:
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

task 1:
Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

task 2:
Write a function that returns the length of a string.

task 3:
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

Prototype: int factorial(int n);

If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error

Factorial of 0 is 1

task 4:
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);

If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

task 5:
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

task 6:
Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

task 7:
Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

task8:
Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
